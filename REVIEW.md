# REVIEW — the fresh-eyes findings

Written daily by the Fresh-eyes review workflow (06:10 UTC): a separate,
empty context reads the last day's changes and the built site against the
corpus, and writes findings here, newest first. It never fixes anything.

Severities: **BLOCKER** (the site is wrong or broken; runs treat as rung 2),
**WARN** (drift or risk; rung 3), **NOTE** (worth knowing, no action forced).
"FOR HIDDE" appears only on judgment calls no run may make alone.

An empty day says "Nothing found." A reviewer that never finds anything is
suspect; a reviewer that finds fifteen nitpicks a day is worse.

**BLOCKER** — Every tree page and question page ships self-contradicting
BreadcrumbList schema for the country crumb (`scripts/build_site.py`,
`crumb_items` at line 2190 for tree pages, line 2374 for question pages;
`breadcrumb_schema()` at line 1070). The country entry is always passed with
`url=None`, so `breadcrumb_schema`'s fallback (`item = url or page_url`,
line 1078) sets its `item` to the current page's own canonical URL. Verified
live on `site/dist/amsterdam/amstelkade-olive-willow.html`: the JSON-LD
BreadcrumbList lists position 2 as `{"name": "Netherlands", "item":
"https://ancienttrees.app/amsterdam/amstelkade-olive-willow"}` and position 4
as `{"name": "The Amstelkade Olive Willow", "item":
"https://ancienttrees.app/amsterdam/amstelkade-olive-willow"}` — the same
URL asserted to be two different, differently-named pages. This is not
edge-case: it happens on every tree/question page regardless of whether a
country page exists (same defect confirmed on `cork/witchs-yew.html`,
Ireland has no country page yet). Only the city-page builder (line
2455-2456) actually looks up `country_pages` for a real URL; the tree and
question page builders never picked up that lookup when Contract G shipped
yesterday (commit b71072c, "Country pages ship"). Violates P4 ("every fact
that appears as prose also appears as structured data... schema is not an
add-on, it is the second rendering of the page") and is exactly the
self-contradicting-page failure class the 2026-07-29 QA walk was written to
catch. Visible effect beyond the schema: on tree pages the Netherlands
breadcrumb still renders as plain, unlinked text even now that `/netherlands`
exists, while the city page one level up correctly links it — an
inconsistency between two page types describing the same fact.

**BLOCKER** — `data/countries/netherlands.json`'s `meta_description` says
"Sheltered survivors across **11** mapped cities", and that exact string is
emitted verbatim as the `<meta name="description">`, `og:description`, AND
the `CollectionPage` schema `description` on the live `/netherlands` page
(`scripts/build_site.py` line 2996: `description =
intro_data.get("meta_description", "")`, used as-is). The same page's
answer-first paragraph and its own rendered city list say "**13** cities"
and list 13 rows summing to 66 trees, which is the correct, current count.
Delft and Den Bosch shipped yesterday (commits 951554, f9ebd36), taking the
Netherlands from 11 to 13 published cities, without the hand-written intro
file being updated. Result: the page's search snippet, its social-share
description and its own machine-readable schema all state a stale number
that the page's own H1 paragraph immediately contradicts. Violates P7
("truth outranks polish") and P2 (the answer-first sentence should be
quotable standalone; here two different "quotable" numbers exist on the
same page). Fix is a one-line edit to the `meta_description` field in
`data/countries/netherlands.json`.

No FOR HIDDE on either: both are build bugs a run can fix directly
(re-derive the country breadcrumb URL for tree/question pages the way the
city page already does; edit one string in the Netherlands intro file).
